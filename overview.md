#### Overview & Example Datasets

**Automated machine learning** (**AutoML**) is the process of [automating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation) the tasks of applying [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) to real-world problems. AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable machine learning model. AutoML was proposed as an [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning#cite_note-autoweka1-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning#cite_note-AutoML2014ICML-2)

In this App we are using H20 auto ml library to automate the machine learning tasks.

#### How to use this App

1. Upload training data from sidebar panel
2. Go to Data Summary tab and select Y and X variables from sidebar panel and then select task at hand i.e. classification or regression
3. Select percentage of data required for training the model
4. Select Maximum Training Time for each model (in secs)
5. Click on Train model 



Once your model is trained, You may find all the candidate models and best model in Result Leaderboard tab. For detailed training  of each model you may refer to Best Model tab.

#### Predict new dataset

After training the model you can predict new dataset by uploading it from sidebar panel.

Once your data is uploaded, you can download predicted data from Prediction Output tab.

***Note: Prediction data should contains all the features used while training the model.***
